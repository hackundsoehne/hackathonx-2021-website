question: How does a hybrid hackathon work? 
--- 
We provide COVID-19 safe areas for you at museum x and offer a digital onboarding if you can't travel to Karlsruhe. You can work in your team physically at the museum x, digitally, or in a hybrid form. It's up to you! All community events are provided on stream.
