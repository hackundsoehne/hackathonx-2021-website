title: "Challenge 3"
subtitle: "Artificial Intelligence"

Do you want to be part of the exciting process of using Artificial Intelligence to make the museum collections more accessible and open to researchers and the public? Together with the Allard Pierson in Amsterdam, the Baden State Museum is working on opening up AI for museums and wants to make corresponding approaches fruitful for our users.

How can machine learning help make the museum's collection and digital offerings more accessible and fun? How does a recommendation system look like, based on the digital collection and existing digital offerings that support users in receiving exactly the information they want in a personalized way? How do we open up the museum as a space for open-linked data to existing databases or open knowledge graphs? What does individualized surprising content look like that provides access and enables your own productions? What support can machine learning provide to navigate millennia of cultural history and a digital collection of over a million objects? How does a unique algorithm look like that gives users worldwide access to their history and empowers them to tell their own story?

### Prizes

- First place: 1500€
- Second place: 1000€
- Third place: 500€

### Judging Criteria

Each juror judges the submitted ideas according to their field of expertise. We have museum specialists, Machine Learning Specialists, and AI researchers as well as a public board. If your idea can convince the jury, you just might win.

### Prerequisites

We will provide a large package of museum object data and information about the collections, user data, and relevant linked data.

### Development plan

After the Hackathon, the best teams are invited to submit their concepts in a development phase of 5 weeks to win a price of 5000€.
