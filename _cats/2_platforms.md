Digital platforms are one of the hottest topics coming out of the COVID19 crisis. Museums around the world are currently working on ways to move their offers online. At Badisches Landesmuseum we are building a participatory digital platform for sharing, learning, discussing and creating to bring museums and users together in conversation around current topics. The central question is: how can the museum become a creative think tank and maker space for everybody.
We are currently working on the concept for this platform and will go into implementation over the summer. By entering this challenge you have the chance to work on a live project and your prototype might end up in the platform. You have three possibilities to enter this challenge.

Develop creative solutions for the existing concept:
- You can develop composition and design tools that enable users to create their own micro courses
- You can build communication tools that are more than zoom and can be used by anyone
- You can build workshop tools for collaboration in a digital maker space

Build prototypes for new platform modules to push the concept further:
- You can build AR tools that enable users to create their own exhibitions outside the museum
- You can build tools to create digital exhibitions that are more than copies of physical spaces
- You can build a storytelling-tool where users and the museum can create and share content

Or you think of something unique and new that we don't envision yet.

No matter which scenario you chose, with this challenge you will be working on one of the most relevant topics for museums and society at large right now. By building this platform we are not simply copying the physical space, we are creating digital formats for the new digital museum. If you are a fantastic team and want to help make museums become more exciting and creative spaces for everyone, or just work on cool tools for communication and co-creation, then this challenge is for you.
