#### What can you expect?
{: .accent-tc}
Work with motivated people and bring your ideas to life. You will join a team of up to 5 people to work on a hardware or software project. Since planning is difficult in the current situation and everything is about the digital museum, hackathon x - vol. 2 will be held digitally on gather.town. Experienced mentors will support you and exciting inputs will inspire you.

After hacking through the weekend, you will present your prototype to our jury. Each juror judges the submitted ideas according to their field of expertise. If your idea can convince the majority of them, you just might win.
