Work with motivated people and bring your ideas to life. You will join a team of up to 5 people to work on a hardware or software project. Our experienced mentors will support you.

After hacking through the weekend, you will present your prototype in front of our [jury](/jury.html). Each juror judges the submitted ideas according to their field of expertise. If your idea can convince the majority of them, you just might win.

Admission and catering is completely free. Apply now (coming soon!) for an unforgettable experience, meet inspiring people and build some awesome projects.
