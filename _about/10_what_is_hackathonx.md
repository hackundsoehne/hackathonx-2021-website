hackathon x is a cooperation between Hack & Söhne, museum x at the Badisches Landesmuseum and Allard Pierson at the University of Amsterdam. After the first hackathon x was entirely dedicated to "Gaming in Museums" in 2019, this year's hackathon x – vol. 2 will be more broadly dedicated to the "Digital Museum", include several challenges and follow an open-source policy.

The background to hackathon x - vol. 2 is the revolutionary new concept of the Badisches Landesmuseum: museum visitors become active users of the museum. To this end, the objects are made accessible in a digital catalogue, the entrance ticket is replaced by a user card linked to a personal user account, and a variety of innovative concepts on escape games, digital platforms and artificial intelligence are experimented with.

Join us and become part of this special hackathon! We are looking for people who want to develop the digital museum together with us. Let’s develop playful, surprising and intelligent approaches to the museum, the collections or the existing digital infrastructure. A special extra: particularly exciting ideas can also be further developed or even implemented after the hackathon.
