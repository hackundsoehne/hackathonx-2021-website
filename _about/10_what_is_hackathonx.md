hackathon x is a cooperation between Hack & Söhne and the museum x, which is dedicated to opening up the Badisches Landesmuseum to the participation of its users and developing new digital concepts. 
Since the museum visit should not only be educational, but also entertaining and fun, the focus of the hackathon is on Artificial Intelligence, Rapid Response & experience & gaming in museums.

The background to the hackathon is the revolutionary new concept of the Badisches Landesmuseum: museum visitors become active users of the museum. 
For this purpose, the objects are made accessible in a digital catalogue and the admission ticket is replaced by a user card linked to a personal user account.

Join us and become part of this special hackathon! We are looking for people who want to develop the digital museum together with us.
Let’s develop playful and smart approaches to the museum, the collections or the existing digital infrastructure. 
A special extra: particularly exciting ideas can also be further developed or even implemented after the hackathon.
